üí° Secure File Lock App Idea

üéØ Core Concepts of the App

1. Complete File Isolation

Files will not appear anywhere outside the app:
- Not in the gallery
- Not in the file manager
- Not in other apps

2. Encrypted Storage

All files are encrypted using AES-256:
- Files are unreadable without the app
- Protected even if the device is accessed

3. Strong Authentication

App is locked with a strong password:
- Option to add fingerprint/face unlock later
- Sessions are time-limited

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Importing Files

- User taps "Import"
- Selects files from the device
- App copies files to a secure zone
- Optionally deletes original files
- Encrypts and stores the files

2. Viewing Files

- Files are temporarily decrypted in memory
- Displayed inside the app interface
- No unencrypted copies are stored

3. Deleting Files

- Deletes encrypted files
- Wipes any traces from memory
